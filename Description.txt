Hello, it's Jad Mattar. This is a description file of the project.

In this code, after building an AI agent that solves the sudoku using csp and backtracking, we are going to make a model that read the Sudoku as image and solve the Sudoku and print the correct numbers on the image.

Main Rule:
Each row, column and block (9 spaces each) needs to be filled out with the numbers from 1 to 9, without repeating any numbers within the row, column or square.

The solution should be returned based on the rule indicated above, no matter whether the sudoku is in easy or medium or hard mode.
We used pytesseract library in order to read the numbers after preprocessing and filtering the images. You should install the library and link to the executer in line 5 of the file pyteseract_Sudoku.py.
Read the image in line 5 of Main_project.py and the solution is saved in Solved_Sudoku.png.
Nums folder is a folder that saves the numbers read on the sudoku.
